# ML4SCI MNIST Anomaly Detection Project

This project is part of my preparation for Google Summer of Code 2026 with ML4SCI.
In this project I will build a basic anomaly detection model using an autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.


## Week 1 — Data exploration (Dec 1–7)
- Set up project scaffold and virtual environment.
- Created notebook `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` that loads MNIST.
- Visualized 16 sample digits and saved `results/plots/sample_grid.png`.
- Saved dataset stats to `results/dataset_stats.json`.

- (record) Week 1: created MNIST exploration notebook and saved sample grid.
